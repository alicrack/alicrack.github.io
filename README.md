title: Telecom Tower Analysis Using AI and Drones
description: This project focuses on the intelligent inspection of telecommunications towers
using autonomous drones and artificial intelligence algorithms.
Drones capture high-resolution images and video from multiple angles,
eliminating the need for manual high-risk inspections.
Computer vision models detect corrosion, cracks,
antenna misalignment, loose cables, and structural defects.
The system enables predictive maintenance and data-driven decisions.
As a result, safety is improved, operational efficiency increases,
and maintenance costs for critical infrastructure are reduced.
